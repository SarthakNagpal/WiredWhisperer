#### Data Preprocessing App

This Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for exploring, cleaning, and preprocessing datasets for machine learning tasks. The app allows users to upload their CSV datasets and performs various data preprocessing steps, including handling null values, exploring unique values, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and outlier detection. Users can download the processed dataset at each stage to facilitate seamless integration into their machine learning pipelines.

#### Key Features:

* EDA with Sweetviz: Explore and visualize the dataset using Sweetviz for quick insights.
* Null Value Handling: Drop or fill null values using mean, mode, median, or custom values.
* Descriptive Statistics: Obtain summary statistics of the dataset.
* Correlation Heatmap: Visualize and analyze correlations between numerical features.
* Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers based on z-scores.
* Download Processed Data: Download the processed dataset after each preprocessing step.
*Encoding and Scaling: Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features for machine learning.

This app is designed to streamline the initial steps of data preparation, making it a valuable tool for data scientists and machine learning practitioners.
